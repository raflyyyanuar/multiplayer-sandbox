# Multiplayer Lobby Base (Godot 4)

This repository exists because I kept recreating multiplayer lobbies for my various game ideas.  
It serves as a reusable base for building multiplayer games using Godot’s high-level multiplayer API and RPCs.

This project focuses solely on the lobby system, including player connection, disconnection, and basic communication.  
It does not cover gameplay-specific networking such as scene replication, state synchronization, or other low-level multiplayer systems.

This was a fun and valuable learning experience in understanding Godot’s networking model.  
The future of this repository is uncertain — I mainly created it as a foundation for my future multiplayer projects.
